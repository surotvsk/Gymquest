/* ============================================================================
   GymQuest — Community configuration (frontend)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This file is loaded BEFORE script.js. Fill in your own Supabase project
   values to turn the OPTIONAL online Community on.

   IMPORTANT — only ever put the PROJECT URL and the PUBLISHABLE (anon) key
   here. They are designed to be public and are safe in frontend code.
   NEVER put the service_role key, a secret key, the database password, or an
   SMTP password in this file, in the repository, or in logs.

   Leave both values empty to keep Community DISABLED: the app then stays
   exactly as before — fully offline, no accounts, no network requests.

   After changing this file you MUST bump CACHE_VERSION in sw.js (and the ?v=
   query strings in index.html) so the service worker re-fetches it.
